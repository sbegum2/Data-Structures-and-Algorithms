1. What is your name?  What do you prefer to be called?

    My name is Samira! It's also my preferred name.


2. Why are you taking CS35?

    I'm interested in CS35 as a prospective CS major at Swarthmore.

    coding part, which I believe this course goes into more depth in.s

programming languages do you know, and which classes have you taken?
    
    I took CS21 at Swarthmore last spring, as well as a DirRdg on the history
    of AI Ethics. I'm only familiar with the Python programmng language.


4. These are a couple questions about how you approach your assignments.

  a. Do you start on your homework as soon as it is assigned or do you
  tend to finish it right before it's due?
  
    I tend to work on it closer to the due date but that's a habit 
    I've between working on.
  
  
  b. When doing group work, do you prefer for your group to split your
  work up into pieces or do you like to work together as a group
  through as much of the material as possible?

    It usually depends on the kind of assignment but I typically enjoy 
    splitting up work and discussing everyone's thought process as we 
    look over our indsvidual parts.


5. What do you consider fun?
    I enjoy rock climbing and spending time outdoors! :)
